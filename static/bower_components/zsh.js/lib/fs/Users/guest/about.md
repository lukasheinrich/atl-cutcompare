* About me
  I'm a Full Stack Developer, JS Passionate, Ruby Fan, C++ Something, Game Development Enthusiast,
  Always willing to contribute to open source projects and trying to learn some more math.

* About this website
  I wanted more than just show my work, I wanted to show my work environment.
  Since I do some mobile development as well  I also use (sadly) some IDEs, but always trying
  to do as much as I can on this terminal, so I made a very similar copy (at least visually)
  of it so people could get to see what I do and how I (usually) do.

* Commands
  If you want to know more about me, there are a few commands:
    * about  (currently running)
    * contact 
    * resume
    * projects

  If you need some help about the terminal, or want to know what functionalities are currrently implemented, type `help` any time.

Hope you have as much fun as I had doing it :)
